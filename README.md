# Background Replacement Pipeline

This repository provides a powerful and efficient background replacement solution. It allows you to replace the background of any image with a new background generated from a text prompt.

## How It Works

The pipeline consists of five main stages that work together to produce high-quality background replacements:

```
+----------------+     +--------------------+     +---------------------+
|                |     |                    |     |                     |
|  Input Image   |---->|  Background        |---->|  Image              |
|  + Text Prompt |     |  Removal           |     |  Resizing           |
|                |     |                    |     |                     |
+----------------+     +--------------------+     +---------------------+
                                                            |
                                                            v
+----------------+     +--------------------+     +---------------------+
|                |     |                    |     |                     |
|  Final Image   |<----|  Background        |<----|  Prompt             |
|  with New      |     |  Generation &      |     |  Enhancement        |
|  Background    |     |  Compositing       |     |  (Optional)         |
+----------------+     +--------------------+     +---------------------+
```



📢 Important Note

This pipeline consists of multiple interconnected components. To make it easier to understand, I have provided both detailed explanations and code snippets for key parts of the process.

While I cannot share the exact API implementation of our production pipeline (as it is deeply integrated into our internal system), I have extracted and structured the relevant logic for you. These include standalone code snippets to illustrate each stage of the process.

Additionally, I have included the full pipeline code in the utils directory. However, this version is part of a larger system, which includes additional functionalities such as product placement and solid color background replacement. As a result, it may not be fully understandable in isolation. Nevertheless, I am providing it for transparency, and you are welcome to explore or use any relevant parts as needed.

If you require additional components or clarifications, please feel free to reach out. My goal is to provide clear and useful information without unnecessary complexity.



## 📌 **Pipeline Stages**

### 1️⃣ **Background Removal**
- Uses an **advanced AI model (Bria RMBG 2.0)** to precisely separate the foreground object from its background.
- Produces a **high-quality alpha mask** to maintain fine details (e.g., hair, edges).

### 2️⃣ **Image Resizing**
- Adjusts image dimensions for optimal performance.
- **Resizes the image to ~1M pixels** while maintaining aspect ratio.
- Ensures consistent quality and compatibility with AI models.

### 3️⃣ **Prompt Enhancement (Optional)**
- Uses an **LLM-based refinement** to **optimize the user’s text prompt**.
- Removes irrelevant or problematic terms (e.g., celebrity names, brand restrictions).
- Ensures a more coherent and suitable background generation process.

### 4️⃣ **Background Generation & Compositing**
- Uses **Bria ReplaceBGInference** to generate a new background based on the refined prompt.
- **Blends the original foreground seamlessly** into the newly generated background.
- Applies **adaptive color harmonization** to ensure a natural look.

## 🔗 **Additional Notes**
- This pipeline **does not provide executable code** but instead serves as an **overview of the methodology**.
- Code snippets for each processing stage are available for reference.

✨ This repository is designed to offer a clear **technical breakdown** of background replacement using AI. 🚀
